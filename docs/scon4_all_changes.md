# SCON4 All Changes

This page lists all changes in the current version of SCON4 since vanilla GNT4.

## Legend

All directions use numpad notation. For example, 6B is holding forward and pressing B.
5B is pressing B without holding a direction on the stick.


![Numpad](/assets/images/changelog/numpad.jpg)

- RA is running A
- JB is jumping B
- J2A would be jumping, holding down, and pressing A
- 6A(A) means that we are talking about the second A press in the 6A string
- S5X means in Sharingan mode for Sasuke and Kakashi. Similar for other transformations.
- 1C or 2C means charged once or twice respectively
- Act4A means the activated part of a 4A counter. This can also be seen on command grabs such as Tsunade's Jump A as ActJA
- A8A means the activated part of 8A.
- GRKnJ and ARKnJ are ground and air attack substitutions; LKnJ is the non attack version
- 5X8 is an example where the move begins with 5X but needs a press of 8 to do something different. This essentially works like 8X, but it is different solely for comboing into the move as if you input 8X and release the 8, you will do 5X. These moves are seen at the first active frame of the move in most cases
- DI (Directional Input) is on a few air moves. This allows you to hold forward or back as you begin the move to change how your momentum is applied
- Ring is a combo with multiple options depending on direction pressed
- ~ is the transition between moves, so 5A~A is the minimum time the game needed to initiate the second 5A
- lowercase letters mean an input is being slid from
- [] means a button is being held down

## General Changes

- Menus and text have been translated to English
- Screen doesn't slow down on character death
- Music doesn't stop on pause
- Stage select screen has diagrams with sizes for the stages
- Unlocks everything by default
- Stand resets intangibility
- Turn around is three frames faster
- Dash transitions to run on frame 6 (from 8)
- New backdashes instead of back flips
- Landing on your face, bouncing on your back or face, and crumple restores your ability to substitute
- Air and Ground grab breaks have guard frames that guard against normal and special attacks
- Jump land doesn't high crush
- Jump land, throw miss, all landing states, more hit states can be grabbed
- Throws cannot be subbed for the first 10 frames of launch
- All grab breaks are now 4 frames from 3 (except Jirobo clap command grab)
- X cannot grab break
- GRKnJs have at a minimum 17 intangible travel frames and will hit on at least frame 29
- 4As are grabbable the entire duration
- Sleep state (Kabuto 2X)
    - Cannot sub until later
    - Resets the combo counter
- Can select which RKnJ you use while in the air. If pressing R, then your character will do the air sub, if pressing 2R then they will do the ground sub
- Wake up attacks added. If holding A or B on frame 15 of a neutral getup, the character will transition to a get up attack. These are fully intangible for four frames and then immune to mids and highs until the hitbox disappears. They are -21 on block
- Optional default settings changed:
    - 60 to 90 seconds
- Training default settings changed:
    - 2P Action changed to 2P Control
    - Chakra Recovery changed to OFF
    - Show Inputs changed to OFF
- Added new blood texture for certain types of damage
- All hitstun states cannot high crush anymore (low hitting counter attacks)
- HP Pools have been normalized, to reduce variance
- Guard Break (Airborne and Grounded) ability to shake out is reduced to a minimum of 40 frames (from 30)
- Running side steps have been given the ability to track onto the opponent from any distance, these were modelled after those in REV3 to allow new uses for offensive approaching and counterplaying chicken blocking. This also allows running step to turn around to face the opponent when back turned.
- It was determined that the defensive power of Jump-Back was too powerful and made the game overly defensive. Many new system mechanics hope to provide universal counterplay to jumping for all characters.
- When you run the game without a memory card, everything will be correctly unlocked now (e.g. Difficulty 4)
- Rounds default to 3 in options
- Default Menu Option is "Battle Mode" instead of "Three Man Cell"
- Damage for "reversal" supers has been normalized down across the board
- Slide inputs have been introduced. These inputs are common in Tekken and Soul Calibur. Simply slide your thumb/finger from the first button to the second quickly to use.
- The moves that activate even when blocked (example Chouji 8A) will also activate when clashing the initial hitbox

Note: 3-Man Cell is currently non-functional.
