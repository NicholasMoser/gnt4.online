# SCON4 All Changes

This page lists all changes in the current version of SCON4 since vanilla GNT4.

## Legend

All directions use numpad notation. For example, 6B is holding forward and pressing B.
5B is pressing B without holding a direction on the stick.


![Numpad](/assets/images/changelog/numpad.jpg)

- RA is running A
- JB is jumping B
- J2A would be jumping, holding down, and pressing A
- 6A(A) means that we are talking about the second A press in the 6A sting
- S5X means in Sharingan mode for Sasuke and Kakashi. Stance for Shikamaru. Similar for other transformations.
- 0C, 1C, or 2C means uncharged, charged once, or charged twice respectively
- Act4A means the activated part of a 4A counter. This can also be seen on command grabs such as Tsunade's Jump A as ActJA
- A8A means the activated part of 8A.
- GRKnJ and ARKnJ are ground and air attack substitutions; LKnJ is the non attack version
- 5X8 is an example where the move begins with 5X but needs a press of 8 to do something different. This essentially works like 8X, but it is different solely for comboing into the move as if you input 8X and release the 8, you will do 5X. These moves are seen at the first active frame of the move in most cases
- DI (Directional Input) is on a few air moves. This allows you to hold forward or back as you begin the move to change how your momentum is applied
- Ring is a combo with multiple options depending on direction pressed
- ~ is the transition between moves, so 5A~A is the minimum time the game needed to initiate the second 5A

## Gameplay Change

- Runstop (the action where your character ends their run cycle, that could only be acted out of with attacks or jumps) is functionally gone. This allows you to run and stop on a dime, run and walk either direction, run into backdash, run into normal sidestep instead of runstep, and run into turnaround when you’re backturned.
- Wake up attacks added. If holding A or B on frame 15 of a neutral get-up, the character will transition to a get-up attack. These are fully intangible for four frames and then immune to mids and highs until the hitbox disappears. They are -21 on block
- New system mechanics were implemented to provide universal counterplay to jumping for all characters. This is because the defensive power of jump-back was too powerful and made the game overly defensive.
- Running side steps have been given the ability to track onto the opponent from any distance. These were modelled after those in REV3 to allow new uses for offensive approaching and counter-playing jump-back. This also allows running step to turn around to face the opponent when back turned.
- New backdashes instead of back flips
- Sound effect plays when a counter-hit occurs
- Stand resets intangibility
- Turn around is three frames faster
- Side step animations adjusted so they begin to leave their position at frame 4 instead of frame 5; same total duration
- Dash transitions to run on frame 6 (from 8)
- Dash stop, like run stop, can be cancelled with an attack or a jump
- Landing on your face, bouncing on your back or face, and crumple restores your ability to substitute
- Jump land doesn't high crush
- HP Pools have been normalized, to reduce variance
- More hit states can be grabbed, e.g. jump land, throw miss, and all landing states,
- Throws cannot be subbed for the first 10 frames of launch
- Air throws are invulnerable during the animation to avoid being hit out of a successful air throw by a move like Itachi’s jA
- Jump attacks have been changed across the cast to make them all air throwable
- Overhead throw unsubbable time frame has intangible added
- Air and ground throw breaks have guard frames that guard against normal and special attacks
- When DEF (autoguard on 4B, counters, etc) is active and you get grabbed, you cannot break the grab
- Throw break window increased globally to 6 frames
- Throw break window normalized between P1 and P2 (in vanilla P1 had 1 less frame to break than P2).
- Throw break can only be done with the A, B, and Y buttons
- Throw break cannot be done with X + Y
- 4As are grabbable the entire duration
- GRKnJs have at a minimum 17 intangible travel frames and will hit on at least frame 29
- All hitstun states cannot high crush anymore (low hitting counter attacks)
- Grounded and air guard break ability to shake out is reduced to a minimum of 40 frames (from 30)
- Grounded guard break removes intangible status
- Damage for "reversal" supers has been normalized down across the board
- The moves that activate even when blocked (example Chouji 8A) will also activate when clashing the initial hitbox
- Most counter 4A’s durations are reduced greatly by shortening the time the character stays in the pose (list below)
- A glitch when certain counters are activated, but don’t “capture” the victim (Hinata and A. Hinata 2X, Hinata 4A, Lee 4A, Sasuke S4A) will create an intangible state for the character initiating the counter and leave them unable to move. This was adjusted to create a state where the activated counter person is stuck in place, but hittable
- TDOWN flag not lingering after attacks end (prevents issues where characters could be thrown out of blockstun in some situations after tdown becomes active)

## System Defaults Changes

- Default Menu Option is "Battle Mode" instead of "Three Man Cell"
- Default "Battle Mode" option is 1v1 Fight
- Battle default settings changed:
    - Match time changed from 60 to 90 seconds
    - Rounds changed from 2 to 3
- Training default settings changed:

    - Chakra Recovery changed to OFF
    - Show Inputs changed to OFF

## User Interface Changes

- Menus and text have been translated to English
- Stage select screen has diagrams with sizes for the stages
- New textures for health bars
- Display version of SCON4 at top of main menu
- Fix P1 Health Bar Spacing (it was not consistent with P2's Health Bar)
- Move crisis section in health bar over a single pixel to make it more accurate for when crisis mode has been entered

## General Changes

- Unlocks everything by default
- Added recording option to training mode, allowing you to define inputs for the CPU to repeat.
- Hold Start to Pause in non-training battle modes
- Display the controller of who paused/disconnected in the pause menu title
- Replace character select screen music with new song from Brutalmoon
- Screen doesn't slow down on character death
- Music doesn't stop on pause
- Added new blood texture for certain types of damage
- Remove CS2 fireball clash
- Remove pipe in Konoha Hospital that can block the camera

Note: 3-Man Cell is currently non-functional.
